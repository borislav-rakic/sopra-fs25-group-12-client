      <Paragraph style={{ color: "white" }}>
        Hearts is a trick-taking card game played with 4 players. The{" "}
        <strong>GOAL</strong> is to avoid gaining points by{" "}
        <strong>NOT COLLECTING HEARTS ‚ô•</strong> or the{" "}
        <strong>QUEEN OF SPADES ‚ô†</strong>.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph style={{ color: "white" }}>
        At the start of each match, every player receives{" "}
        <strong>13 CARDS</strong>. Matches are played over{" "}
        <strong>13 ROUNDS</strong>, and in each round, players take turns
        playing one card at a time.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph style={{ color: "white" }}>
        Before the <strong>first round</strong> begins, each player selects{" "}
        <strong>3 cards</strong> from their hand to pass to another player.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph style={{ color: "white", marginBottom: "0.5em" }}>
        <strong>Round 1:</strong> Pass to the player on your{" "}

        <strong>Round 4:</strong> <em>No passing</em>.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph style={{ color: "white" }}>
        From Round 5 onward, this pattern repeats. After passing, you&apos;ll receive
        {" "}
        <strong>3 cards</strong>{" "}
        from another player, so you&apos;ll hold a full hand of{" "}
        <strong>13 cards</strong>.

      <Paragraph style={{ color: "white" }}>
        The player holding the <strong>Two of Clubs ‚ô£</strong>{" "}
        must start the first trick by playing that card. All other players must

      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph style={{ color: "white" }}>
        <strong>Hearts</strong> and the <strong>Queen of Spades ‚ô†</strong>{" "}

        This group of four played cards is called a{" "}

        The <strong>WINNER</strong>{" "}

        yet.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph style={{ color: "white" }}>
        <strong>üíî BREAKING HEARTS:</strong>{" "}
        You cannot lead a trick with a Heart card until someone has already
        played a Heart in a previous trick (because they couldn&apos;t follow
        suit). This is known as ‚Äúbreaking hearts‚Äù.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph style={{ color: "white" }}>
        After all 13 tricks in a round are completed, each player counts the

        These points are added to your total score for the game.

        The match continues until all 13 rounds are played. The player with the
