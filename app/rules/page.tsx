          Welcome to <strong>Hearts Attack!</strong> If you&apos;re new to the game, here&apos;s everything you need to know.
        </Paragraph>
  
        <Title level={3} style={{ color: "white" }}>üéÆ Gameplay</Title>
        <Paragraph style={{ color: "white" }}>
          Hearts is a trick-taking card game played with 4 players. The <strong>GOAL</strong> is to avoid gaining points by <strong>NOT COLLECTING HEARTS ‚ô• </strong> or the <strong>QUEEN OF SPADES ‚ô†</strong>.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph style={{ color: "white" }}>
          At the start of each match, every player receives <strong>13 CARDS</strong>. Matches are played over <strong>13 ROUNDS</strong>, and in each round, players take turns playing one card at a time.
        </Paragraph>
  
        <Paragraph style={{ color: "white" }}>
          Before the <strong>FIRST ROUND</strong> begins, each player selects <strong>3 CARDS</strong> from their hand to pass to another player:
          <br />
          <strong>Round 1</strong> ‚Üí Pass to the player on your right
          <br />
          <strong>Round 2</strong> ‚Üí Pass to the next player clockwise
          <br />
          <strong>Round 3</strong> ‚Üí Continue rotating...
          <br />
          After passing, you&apos;ll receive 3 cards from another player.
        </Paragraph>
  
        <Paragraph style={{ color: "white" }}>
          The player holding the <strong>TWO OF CLUBS ‚ô£ </strong> always starts the first round by playing that card. The other players must follow suit (play a club ‚ô£) if they can. If they don&apos;t have that suit, they can play any other card.
        </Paragraph>
  
        <Paragraph style={{ color: "white" }}>
          This group of four played cards is called a <strong>TRICK</strong>. The player who plays the <strong> HIGHEST CARD</strong> in the lead suit (the suit of the first card played) <strong>WINS THE TRICK</strong> and <strong>COLLECTS</strong> the 4 cards.
        </Paragraph>
  
        <Paragraph style={{ color: "white" }}>
          The <strong> WINNER</strong> of the trick leads the next round with a card of their choice ‚Äî unless that card is a heart and Hearts haven&apos;t been &quot;broken&quot; yet.
        </Paragraph>
  
        <Paragraph style={{ color: "white" }}>
          <strong>üíî BREAKING HEARTS:</strong> You cannot lead a trick with a Heart card until someone has already played a Heart in a previous trick (because they couldn&apos;t follow suit). This is known as ‚Äúbreaking hearts‚Äù.
        </Paragraph>
  
        <Paragraph style={{ color: "white" }}>
          After each of the 13 rounds, the cards a player has won in tricks are counted. Any Hearts in those tricks are worth <strong>1 point</strong>, and the Queen of Spades is worth <strong>13 points</strong>. Your total score increases by this amount.
        </Paragraph>
  
        <Paragraph style={{ color: "white" }}>
          The match continues until all 13 rounds are played. The player with the <strong>LOWEST TOTAL SCORE</strong> at the end is the winner.
        </Paragraph>
  
        <Paragraph style={{ color: "white" }}>
          <strong>üåô SHOOTING THE MOON:</strong> If you manage to collect <strong>ALL 13 HEARTS</strong> and the <strong>QUEEN OF SPADES</strong> in a single round, you &quot;shoot the moon&quot;! Instead of getting 26 points, you get <strong>0</strong> and everyone else gets 26 points. It&apos;s a bold and risky move ‚Äî but it can turn the game around!
