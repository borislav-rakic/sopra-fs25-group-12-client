# HEARTS ATTACK!

This project is a web app implementation of the classic card game Hearts.

## Introduction

_the project‚Äôs goal and motivation_

We are designing an online version of the card game ‚ÄúHearts‚Äù, in which players
can meet online for a match or complete their group with virtual players. Our
aim is to provide players with detailed statistics of previous wins/losses so
they can track their progress and compare their skills with other players.

## Launch & Deployment

_Write down the steps a new developer joining your team would have to take to
get started with your application. What commands are required to build and run
your project locally? How can they run the tests? Do you have external
dependencies or a database that needs to be running? How can they do releases?_

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

### Running the Application Locally

### Clone The Repository

`git clone https://github.com/borislav-rakic/sopra-fs25-group-12-client`

### Navigate to the cloned directory in the terminal

`cd sopra-fs25-student-client`

### Inside the repository folder (with `ls` you can list files) there is a bash script _setup.sh_ that will install everything you need, according to the system you are using. Run the following command and follow the instructions

```shell
source setup.sh
```

### Start Development Server

`npm start` or `npm run dev`

### Running Tests

`npm test`

### External Dependencies

### Releases

`npm run build`

## Illustrations

_In your client repository, briefly describe and illustrate the main user
flow(s) of your interface. How does it work (without going into too much
detail)? Feel free to include a few screenshots of your application._

## Roadmap

_The top 2-3 features that new developers who want to contribute to your project
could add_

Here are the top 2‚Äì3 features that new developers who want to contribute to the
project could add:
