# HEARTS ATTACK!

This project is a web app implementation of the classic card game Hearts.

## Introduction

_the project‚Äôs goal and motivation_

We are designing an online version of the card game ‚ÄúHearts‚Äù, in which players
can meet online for a match or complete their group with virtual players. Our
aim is to provide players with detailed statistics of previous wins/losses so
they can track their progress and compare their skills with other players.

## High-Level Components

_Identify your project‚Äôs 3-5 main components. What is their role? How are they
correlated? Reference the main class, file, or function in the README text with
a link._

### 1. **MatchPage Component**

- **File:** [`/app/match/[id]/page.tsx`](./app/match/[id]/page.tsx)
- **Role:** Handles the main game view, including card rendering, trick
  management, score display, and player interactions.
- **Correlation:** Communicates with the backend to fetch and update game state.

### 2. **StartPage Component**

- **File:** [`/app/start/[id]/page.tsx`](./app/start/[id]/page.tsx)
- **Role:** Handles the match setup and invites players. This page allows the host to configure the match by selecting players, setting game rules (e.g., point limits), and inviting players (either humans or AI).
- **Correlation:** Communicates with the backend to to manage player invitations, configure match settings, and retrieve the match state (e.g., invites, current players). It may also handle AI configuration.

### 3. **Profile Component**

- **File:** [`/app/profile/[id]/page.tsx`](./app/profile/[id]/page.tsx)
- **Role:** Displays and allows the user to edit their profile information such as username, avatar, and personal statistics (e.g., games played, win rate).
- **Correlation:** Communicates with the backend to fetch the user's profile data and allows for updates. 

### 4. **Leaderboard Component**

- **File:** [`/app/leaderboard/page.tsx`](./app/leaderboard/page.tsx)
- **Role:** Displays the leaderboard showing scores and rankings of players in the game. It keeps track of each player's progress across different matches.
- **Correlation:** Communicates with the backend to fetch player statistics and scores and updates the leaderboard accordingly.

### 5. **Friends Component**

- **File:** [`/app/friends/[id]/page.tsx`](./app/friends/[id]/page.tsx)
- **Role:** Manages the user's friends list, including sending and receiving friend requests, viewing accepted friends, and handling pending or declined requests.
- **Correlation:** Communicates with the backend to send and receive friend requests, display a list of accepted friends, and update the friends list based on user actions.

## Launch & Deployment

_Write down the steps a new developer joining your team would have to take to
get started with your application. What commands are required to build and run
your project locally? How can they run the tests? Do you have external
dependencies or a database that needs to be running? How can they do releases?_

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

### Running the Application Locally

### Clone The Repository

`git clone https://github.com/borislav-rakic/sopra-fs25-group-12-client`

### Navigate to the cloned directory in the terminal

`cd sopra-fs25-student-client`

### Inside the repository folder (with `ls` you can list files) there is a bash script _setup.sh_ that will install everything you need, according to the system you are using. Run the following command and follow the instructions

```shell
source setup.sh
```

### Start Development Server

`npm start` or `npm run dev`

### Running Tests

`npm test`

### External Dependencies

### Releases

`npm run build`

## Illustrations

_In your client repository, briefly describe and illustrate the main user
flow(s) of your interface. How does it work (without going into too much
detail)? Feel free to include a few screenshots of your application._
