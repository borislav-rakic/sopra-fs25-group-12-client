# HEARTS ATTACK!
This project is a web app implementation of the classic card game Hearts.

## Introduction
_the project’s goal and motivation_

We are designing an online version of the card game “Hearts”, in which players can meet online for a match or complete their group with virtual players. Our aim is to provide players with detailed statistics of previous wins/losses so they can track their progress and compare their skills with other players.

## Launch & Deployment
_Write down the steps a new developer joining your team would
have to take to get started with your application. What commands are required to build and
run your project locally? How can they run the tests? Do you have external dependencies
or a database that needs to be running? How can they do releases?_

### Prerequisites  
Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
